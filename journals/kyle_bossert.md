### Kyle's Engineer Journal
Week 14: Made a users Postgresql table, finished CRUD endpoints for the users table. Finished Friday evening with 5 endpoints, and with the Authenticatior file.

Week 15: Starting off strong, created a Groups table and a Membership table to track membership to each group. Trying to figure out what endpoints need protecting. Also added Get All endpoint and Create Group endpoint. I'm thinking create group should be protected that way only logged in users can create a group.
