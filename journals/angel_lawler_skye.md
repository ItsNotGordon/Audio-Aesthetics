### Angel's Engineer Journal

Today, we mob programmed to:

-try to add protection to our existing endpoints in line with project requirements.

Previously, I thought that all authorization would be handled on the front-end with the only backend authentication being login/logout but now I think my understanding is that we need to all have created at least 2 protected endpoints for our grade.

Currently trying to find a modular way to update all existing endpoints to redirect any users who aren't logged in back to login page as part of our endpoint protection but at minimum need to make sure I add protection and test it to the endpoints I created on Nov 17.

Today, we mob programmed to:

-completed all of our users endpoints to include all CRUD functionality.

-tested all users endpoints to ensure expected successful responses containing expected data.

-dramatic save from teammates at the last minute re: the update user endpoint so heading into the weekend with that win is nice. Gooooo team Tunity!

## November 13-16, 2023

The rest of Week 14 included mob programming to:

Set up our PostgreSQL database.

Create our users data table.

make migrations for that table.

started auth for users back-end. not entirely sure if we completed it, still not sure what all feature will require login yet but we definitely completed backend auth for login/logout. We used JWTs.
